This repository demonstrates some less common but potentially problematic issues in VBScript.  The `bug.vbs` file showcases examples of late binding problems, implicit type conversion surprises, and the lack of robust error handling.  The `bugSolution.vbs` offers improved versions with solutions to mitigate these issues.  This is particularly relevant for maintaining or troubleshooting legacy VBScript code.
